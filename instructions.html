<p>For best results it is important to select the model that accurately represents your sequence type.</p>
<ul>
<li>For collections of full length proteins you should select the <em>precursor</em> model. This is the most common situation when working with predicted proteins from a translated transcriptome or translated gene models.</li>
<li>The alternative model (<em>mature</em>) is best suited for sequences representing the final AMP sequence after post-translational processing (eg removal of N-terminal signal and pro-peptide sequences). This situation is commonly encountered if your sequences were obtained through direct proteomic sequencing of native material (eg Edman sequencing or mass spectrometry) </li>
</ul>
